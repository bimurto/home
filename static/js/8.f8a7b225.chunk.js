I design solutions using scalable microservice architecture for use of millions of people. I am also\ninterested in DevOps and System Automation. I love learning new technologies and always enthusiastic about using them.\n\n# Life Till Now\n\n- I spent my whole life before college in a beautiful colony at Palash, Narsingdi. The colony was for the people working\n  for Palash Fertilizer Factory Ltd. I lived there for 16 years with my father, mother and sister as my father worked as\n  an engineer. We had a big and beautiful playground in the colony and lots of friends.\n\n- At class 5, I attended a nationwide scholarship exam in my country and somehow got first place among all other\n  candidates in Bangladesh. I got to meet the Prime Minister of our country and got a medal from her.\n\n- At class 8, I got my first computer. I was a single core 2.8 GHz Pentium processor. We did not have internet and I\n  only played games and watched movies on that.\n\n- After my SSC, we moved to Dhaka with my parents for my and my sister's education. My father got transferred to another\n  district, but we stayed in Dhaka. I got admitted in the best Higher Secondary College in Bangladesh Notre Dame\n  College.\n\n- I got my first phone after joining Notre Dame College. It was a BenQ branded phone with media playback support and\n  a .3MP camera. I spent my 2 years by studying, doing quizzes, getting repeats in physics lab and making friends.\n\n- After my Higher Secondary Exam, I studied too hard for getting a chance to admit to the best engineering university in\n  Bangladesh, BUET. Because of my hard work, I placed 84th at the admission exam and chose Computer Science for my\n  major. Thanks to Shohag vai from Udvash for helping me to make that choice.\n\n- I started coding just after out admission test. I started with C and gradually fell in love with Java. That was\n  because of the IDE, Eclipse and the magical Ctrl+Space at that time. Then IntelliJ IDEA made that relation stronger\n  and did not get too much chance to flirt with other languages.\n\n# I like\n\n- Reading\n- Binging Netflix\n- Pretending to be a gourmet\n- Gobbling any info about tech\n- Travelling with friends\n- Watching Anime\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I smoke just because everyone I know smokes, they always complain I am a waste of a Stick\n- I hate the thing most in my life is a slow pc\n- I was an apple hater, but I secretly like the macbook\n- I love linux\n\n# I dream of\n\n- being a better person\n- getting a 6 pack which I guess I never will\n- always learning something new\n- using linux in my workplace\n- get drunk and have a heart to heart chat with my big boss who never drinks.\n\n",d=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(l.jsx)(i.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(l.jsx)(r.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Shawrup K.
