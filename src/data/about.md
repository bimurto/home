# Intro

I am a Software Engineer at [Kona Software Lab Ltd.](https://konasl.com) where I work on Fintech Solutions and Data
Engineering. I design solutions using scalable microservice architecture for use of millions of people. I am also
interested in DevOps and System Automation. I love learning new technologies and always enthusiastic about using them.

# Life Till Now

- I spent my whole life before college in a beautiful colony at Palash, Narsingdi. The colony was for the people working
  for Palash Fertilizer Factory Ltd. I lived there for 16 years with my father, mother and sister as my father worked as
  an engineer. We had a big and beautiful playground in the colony and lots of friends.

- At class 5, I attended a nationwide scholarship exam in my country and somehow got first place among all other
  candidates in Bangladesh. I got to meet the Prime Minister of our country and got a medal from her.

- At class 8, I got my first computer. It was a single core 2.8 GHz Pentium processor. We did not have any internet and
  I only played games and watched movies on that.

- After my SSC, we moved to Dhaka with my parents for my and my sister's education. My father got transferred to another
  district, but we stayed in Dhaka. I got admitted in the best Higher Secondary College in Bangladesh Notre Dame
  College.

- I got my first phone after joining Notre Dame College. It was a BenQ branded phone with media playback support and a
  .3MP camera. I spent my 2 years by studying, doing quizzes, getting repeats in physics lab and making friends.

- After my Higher Secondary Exam, I studied too hard for getting a chance to admit to the best engineering university in
  Bangladesh, BUET. Because of my hard work, I placed 84th at the admission exam and chose Computer Science for my
  major. Thanks to Shohag vai from Udvash for helping me to make that choice.

- I started coding just after out admission test. I started with C and gradually fell in love with Java. That was
  because of the IDE, Eclipse and the magical Ctrl+Space at that time. Then IntelliJ IDEA made that relation stronger
  and did not get too much chance to flirt with other languages.
